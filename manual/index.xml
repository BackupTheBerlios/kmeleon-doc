	<ulink type="http" url="documentation-project.html">The
	K-Meleon documentation project</ulink> is an effort to write
        a complete manual for K-Meleon. Participation is open to
        anyone willing to help. All contributions, large or small, are
        very welcome. And very much needed! You don't have to write a
        full chapter; a small subsection is good enough. Or simply
        extend/rewrite/correct the text of an exisiting part. No
        programming knowledge is required, which makes it a great way
        for non-programmers to contribute to K-Meleon.

        This is version 0.1 of the K-Meleon manual, describing version
        0.7 of K-Meleon.  The manual guides new users through the
        basic steps of K-Meleon, and provide experienced users with a
        thorough reference manual.  As a complement, the <ulink
        type="http" url="http://kmeleon.sourceforge.net">K-Meleon home
        page</ulink> is filled with shorter tutorials aimed to help
        the novice perform a number of common tasks.
